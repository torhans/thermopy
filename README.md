# thermopy 

Python library for thermodynamics and other handy tools. Only python3 is
supported.

Thermodynamics (all these properties as function of temperature for thousands of compounds):

	- Specific heat capacity

	- Enthalpy

	- Entropy


Temperature independent data:

	- Molecular weight

	- Enthalpy of formation


and much more.

For water, pressure is also an input (higher accuracy using IAPWS).

Modelling of chemical reactions is also present. Main features:

	- Equilibrium constant as a function of temperature

	- Heat of reaction as a function of temperature


Handy tools:

	- Units conversion module

	- Hundreds of physical constants


See the documentation for further details and examples.

## Installing
Make sure you have both `numpy` and `scipy` installed.

Then install it:
```
python3 thermopy/setup.py install
```
## Testing

Inside thermopy directory execute:
```
python3 thermopy/setup.py test
```

## Changelog:

v0.5.4:

    - Merge with old 'thermopy3' complete. The only name from now on is
      thermopy.

    - Documentation now using sphinx instead of pdf files.

    - Code compliance and readability improved.

    - Code and logic uniformized.

v0.5.3:
	
	- Merged with original thermopy and discarded the 'thermopy3' name.

	- Added meaningful docstrings to every package, module, class, method and function.

	- Uniformized docstrings to comply with google docstrings style.

	- Improved compliance with PEP 257 and PEP 8.

	- Migrated documentation to sphinx (pdf will no longer be available).

v0.5.2:

    - Changed the names from thermopy to thermopy3 because the former was already in use in pypi.
    
    - IAPWS is now on SI and (molar basis) instead of its native kJ, kg units.

v0.5.1:

	- Fix error with relative import of xml databases.

v0.5.0:

	- First release from v0.4.0.
	
	- Ported from python2.7 to python3.4.

## TODO

    - Despite burcat was supersed with nasa9polynomials update its
      documentation.

	- Transform IAPWS module into molar basis to be consistent with burcat and nasa9polynomials.

	- Fix the setting of a compound when it is ambiguous:
		>>> csbr = db.set_compound('LYQFWZFBNBDLEO-UHFFFAOYSA-M')
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
		  File "/home/monteiro/cloud/cloud_work/fmv1992_github/thermopy/thermopy/nasa9polynomials.py", line 501, in set_compound
			('Ga2O', 'gallium;oxygen(2-)')
		Exception: ("The compound 'LYQFWZFBNBDLEO-UHFFFAOYSA-M' you are trying to set is not unique: CsBr", 'CsBr(cr)')

	- Increase the testing coverage.

    - Implement units for every output so output is not a number but a dimension (e.g. 1 J/kg instead of 1).
